        <p>Okay. here goes my first post. My whole life have been computers till this point. Yes, I do love cars but generally, all the interest gets centered around machines that does stuff. The problem is that lately, I noticed I am not being productive, not doing things that can be considered worthy of mention. Not much coding and creative outputs. Reading does happen, but that has become more of a burden as reading contributes to surplus of thoughts and I don’t have a place to dump them.</p>

<h1 id="why-not-use-blogger-or-wordpress">Why not use blogger or wordpress?</h1>
<p>I want my blog to be lightweight. Not something that will fry the innards of a poor computer. I tried starting a couple of blogs, but ultimately ended up abandoning them. Dont know why, but they did not seem like fun.</p>

<h1 id="why-github--jekyll">Why Github + Jekyll?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Complete control of your blog</li>
  <li>Great community with hacker friendly ethos at its core</li>
  <li>Themes made by people who seem to share my thoughts</li>
  <li>It is fun :D</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I am going to do some serious memory dumps here… hope they will keep coming ;)</p>
