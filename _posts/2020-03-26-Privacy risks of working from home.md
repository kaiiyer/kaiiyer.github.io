The coronavirus pandemic has led to a situation where the offices are packed up and social distancing is proposed by the government. Nations including India, South Africa and UK have announced 21 days of lockdown. But because of the the web era and progress in technology, anyone can carry out their regular work from the comfort of their couch.

Not only can remote workers have their own privacy put in danger, engaging from home could end in breaching company security too.

Many organizations(govt. & non govt.) have allowed work from home. Most of the meetings and interactions are held using tools like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, Hangouts, Citrix etc. But <b>are these apps safe ?</b> Greater privacy risks and employer surveillance is awaiting us.
