                  <p>Should we actually care about privacy during coronavirus pandemic ?
                  </p>
                  <p>Why is privacy a big deal during this crunch ?</p>
                  <p>Let’s understand WHY privacy may be a big enchilada.</p>
                </div>
	          		
                <p>The coronavirus pandemic has led to a situation where the offices are packed up and social distancing is proposed by the government. Nations including India, South Africa and UK have announced 21 days of lockdown. But because of the the web era and progress in technology, anyone can carry out their regular work from the comfort of their couch. Working from home is a luxury but this luxury comes with its downsides. Not only can remote workers have their own privacy put in danger, engaging from home could end in breaching company security too.</p>

                <p>Many organizations(govt. & non govt.) have allowed work from home. Most of the meetings and interactions are held using tools like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, Hangouts, Citrix etc. But are these apps safe ? Greater privacy risks and employer surveillance is awaiting us.</p>

                <p>Most of the developers have used Slack at some point of work. You may have noticed that free slack workspaces only allow visibility to 10k messages. A paid plan enables the user to see messages past the limit. But slack messages which we can’t access are still there in the servers. There’s Slarck which allows the user(usually the admin)to keep a replica of the team chats. Slack should give free account control over retention.</p>

                <p>In slack the admin controls the workspace and has the authority to make policies which may even allow the boss to see your personal slack conversations. Here’s  <a href="http://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools">how.</a> Paying attention to your workspace setting can assist you figure out the admin’s intention.</p>

              <i><b>When you gossip within the office and your boss overhears you there’s still an opportunity of escaping by making some excuse but when your boss has the screenshot of your gossips none of the justifications are gonna save you.</p></b> </i>

                <p>So why put your job and your privacy in danger . Don’t use the meeting app for private conversations.</p>

                <p>Most of the apps like zoom have policies which only tracks if the window is open. Zoom allows admins to ascertain detailed views on users using Zoom, with detailed real -time dashboards. If a user records any calls via Zoom, admins can access the contents of that recorded call. For any meeting that has occurred or is in-process, Zoom allows administrators to determine the OS , IP address, location data, and device information of each participant. Attendee attention tracking tracks attention while someone is sharing a screen. Using End-To-End Encryption for Chat would be a wise choice. Hangouts users may expose their private email address to others within the firm. Although Google says it doesn’t sell your data, they do share, monetize and exploit it. Find how.</p>

                <p>Employee monitoring can go overboard and instead of being a tool that need to increase productivity and efficiency companies means to locate their employees not only during work hours but even during off hours. A number of the privacy endangering features are taking screenshots of employees’ screens at like every 10 minutes, video recordings during off hours, tracking Geo-location and maintaining communication logs. Giving unnecessary permissions like access to sensors or call logs can invite unnecessary privacy risks. Don’t Become a COVID-19 Identity Exploit Victim. Here are a number of the cybersecurity tips for workers working remotely.</p>

                <p>Singapore is doing a reasonably good job of employing a Bluetooth mesh network to perform contact tracing. Data is stored on-device and only are often activated when contact tracing is important. No location data is collected.</p>


            <p>What are the open-source alternatives ?</p>
